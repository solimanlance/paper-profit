# My Personal Project


## Project Description

The project that I propose to design will be some sort of 
**virtual** stock market simulator. In the program, the user
will be able to manage a set amount of funds (ex. $10,000), 
and they will be able to choose from some set amount of stocks 
to **purchase** and **sell**. The market will change according to
a database of past stock history, so that there
will be **no calls to any external systems**.

People who use this program may be beginners looking to get in
the stock market that aren't fully confident to invest yet, 
or just those who are looking to have some fun with investing 
simulated money.

This project is of interest to me, as I've always been interested
in investing and the stock market, but I have never actually had
the opportunity to invest any real money (I'm still not over the age of
majority in BC!). I also think that there are many places to go 
with this project, and that it's **scalable** in the sense that many
interesting features can be added as I see fit.
